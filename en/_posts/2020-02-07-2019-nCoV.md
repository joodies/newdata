## Forcast 2019 nCoV

>up to date: 2020-02-07

>See a lot of recovery in the proportion of severe cases, is the disease concentrated outbreak or hospital treatment efficiency improved?

>The good news is that the proportion of people who have been cured has been steadily increasing. The people across the country are trying to isolate and speed up the healing process, and they will soon be able to go out for a walk.

>The number of confirmed cases has increased steadily, because the inspection capacity of the hospital has not changed much?

>The proportion of non-Hubei confirmed cases has decreased significantly, and the effect of targeting the epidemic in Hubei is obvious.

>When watching the news that **the channel leaving Wuhan is temporarily closed**, I seems to hear that **the channel leaving the earth is temporarily closed**. Who needs to reflect?
